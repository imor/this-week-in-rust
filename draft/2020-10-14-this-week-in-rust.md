## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-10-05](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-10-05.md):
1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 1 Mixed

A quiet week. One rather large regression on a synthetic benchmark and a few
small improvements.

[#77023](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77023) is an interesting
case. It encoded an invariant about slice lengths as an `assume` intrinsic
inside `len` function. It seems to have caused a small compile-time slowdown,
but there was no improvement in `check` build performance (a proxy for generated
code quality). In fact, the LLVM documentation [specifically advises
against](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-assume-intrinsic) overuse of
the `assume` intrinsic in cases where the invariant is unlikely to be of much
help to the optimizer. That seems to be the case here.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-10-05.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs
